# telegramBot 
This is a code repo that shares my personal telegram bot. The bot is a side project I build combining IBM's Watson AI services and third party APIs. The integration of all services happens on a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) server hosted in the [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/). All of this is **possible with a free account**

The Node-RED server in this example is hosted on the IBM cloud but it can just as well run on any local device such as a Raspberry Pi or other servers/desktops/laptops as long as they have internet access.

## Visual Recognition
One of the bot's skills is to see what you see

## Speech to Text
Also, you can dictate your bot something and it will transcribe the spoken words for you. The supported languages are:
- English
- French
- German
- Spanish
- Japanese
- Korean
- Chinese (Mandarin)
- Arabic

## Translation
The bot can also assist you with translations. It will automatically detect which language the input has and translate it to the user desired output language.

## Weather forecast
Get the latest weather updates directly on your smartphone by asking your bot for it. The location is picked from your input and then translated into coordinates by a third party. These coordinates will be used to query the Weather Company database and return accurate results.
