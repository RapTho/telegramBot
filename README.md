# telegramBot 
This is a code repo that shares my personal telegram bot. The bot is kind of a demo to show IBM's Watson AI services in combination with other third party services. The integration of all services happens on a [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) server hosted in the [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/). All of this is **possible with a free account**

##Requirements
- Free [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/) account
- Bot created with Telegram's [Botfather](https://core.telegram.org/bots)
- Free [opencagedata](https://opencagedata.com/) account
- The [Telegram messanger](https://telegram.org/) installed on your smartphone

##IBM Cloud services
The following IBM Cloud services need to be instinciated. Free/light plan is always sufficient.
- [Watson Assistant](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/)
